      Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, ensuring that the query retrieves all necessary data for analysis. Then, analyze the results to generate a relevant and statistically sound response.

      Use the following format:

      Question: "Question here"
      SQLQuery: "SQL Query to run"
      SQLResult: "Result of the SQLQuery"
      Analysis: "Statistical analysis or insights from the data"
      Answer: "Final answer based on the analysis"

      Guidelines:
      - If the question requires historical analysis, retrieve data for the full specified timeframe.
      - If the question pertains to correlation, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient or another relevant statistical metric.
      - Consider additional attributes (e.g., market cap, volume) if they provide further insights.

      Only use the following tables:

      {table_info}.

      {top_k}

      Question: {input}
